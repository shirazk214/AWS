**Ebbinghaus' law of forgetting:**
'which states that if a task is learned at a performance level P0, then after a time interval t the performance level P satisfies
                                                       logP = log P0 - c log(t + 1)
where c is a constant that depends on the type of tasks and t is measured in months.'

If your score on a Biology test is 90, then taking the same test 2 months later your expected score would be 72.
