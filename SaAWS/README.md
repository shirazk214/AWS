## This repository will serve the purpose of learning Serverless application development using Amazon Web Services.
**Autodidacticism**

It will also cross referenced for other AWS study material and also used for review.



## A 24 hour video service will be built to take advantage of AWS Serverless Architecture.

**This will facilitate learning/syntheses of developing on AWS as it pertains to Serverless Architecture**

Part of learning will also mean to follow best practices and guidelines which will be documented.
e.g. This project will implement the five pillars of Serverless Architecture.


   1. **Use a compute service to execute code on demand ( no servers )**
   2. **Write single-purpose stateless functions**
   3. **Design push-based, even-driven pipelines**
   4. **Create thicker, more powerful front ends**
   5. **Embrace third-party services**

The project will take advantage of **Amazon's Simple Storage( S3 ), Lambda and Elastic transcoder**.





**Ebbinghaus' law of forgetting:**

'which states that if a task is learned at a performance level P0, then after a time interval **t** the performance level P satisfies
                                                      **logP = log P0 - c log(t + 1)**
where **c** is a constant that depends on the type of tasks and t is measured in months.'

If your score on a Biology test is 90, then taking the same test 2 months later your expected score would be 72.
