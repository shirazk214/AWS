## Variable vs. Capital Expense

  Instead of having to invest in data centers and services before knowing how to use them, you can  pay
  only when you consume computing resources and pay only for how much you consume.

## Economics of Scale

  Another advantage of cloud computing is that *organizations benefit from massive economies of scale*. Using
  cloud computing can achieve a lower variable cost than would to get your own data-center. As users in
  the thousands are aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economics of scale,
  this in turn translates to lower prices.

## Stop guessing capacity

  Making a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive
  idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, organizations *stop guessing about
  capacity requirements* for the organization, because the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop
  is significantly lower.
