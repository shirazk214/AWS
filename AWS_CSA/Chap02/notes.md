## Core object storage services on AWS: Amazon Simple Storage Service ( Amazon S3 ) and Amazon Glacier

**Amazon S3** is easy *to use* **object storage** with a simple web service interface that can provide users the ability to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the WEB. Amazon S3 allows a customer to pay for only the storage they actually use, **which eliminates the capacity planning and capacity constraints associated with tradition storage**

**S3** was one of the first services introduced by AWS and serves as one of the foundational web-services --nearly any application running in AWS uses S3, either directly or indirectly. Amazon S3 can be used alone or in conjunction with other AWS services, and it offers a very high level of integration with many other AWS cloud services. e.g. it serves as the durable target storage for **Amazon Kinesis and Amazon Elastic Map reduce** .  It is used for storage in **Amazon Elastic Block Store ( EBS )** and for **Amazon Relational Database Service** snapshots. It is also used as a data staging or loading storage mechanism for **Amazon Redshift** and **Amazon DynamoDB**

     S3 is flexible, highly integrated and commonly used.
