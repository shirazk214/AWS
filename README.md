## Five Main principles that define cloud computing

  Summarization of five principles of cloud computing.

  * Pooled computing resource available to any subscribing users

  * Virtualized computing resources to maximize hardware utilization

  * Elastic scaling up or down according to need

  * Automated creation of new virtual machines or deletion of existing ones

  * Resource usage billed only as used.


Pooled resources : Available to any subscribing users

Virtualization :  High utilization of hardware assets

Elasticity    :  Dynamic scale without CAPEX

Automation     : Build, deploy, configure, provision, and move all without manual intervention

Metered Billing : Per-usage business model; pay only for what you use
